## What are the Pros & Cons?

### Pros

- Easily link multiple (mono)repos together that use different package managers.
- Don't have to manually link packages yourself with `npm link` or `yarn link` or `pnpm link`.
- Ignore [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning, especially useful when working with pre-release versions.
- Verify your dependencies are set up correctly.

### Cons

- If a package's dependencies are updated, the lockfile its apart of will not be updated, and you'll have to do that yourself outside the CoSpace unless you purge and re-install.
